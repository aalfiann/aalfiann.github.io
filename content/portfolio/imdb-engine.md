An IMDB Scrapper like you have your own imdb engine.
<!--more-->
*This script is a proof of concept. It’s working, but you shouldn’t use it. IMDb doesn’t allow this method of data fetching. I do not use or promote this script. You’re responsible for using it.*

The technique used is called “web scraping.” Which means, if IMDb changes any of their HTML, the script is going to fail. I won’t update this on a regular basis, so don’t count on it to be working all the time.
