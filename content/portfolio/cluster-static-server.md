## Description
`Static Server` is a static web server, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it `"static"` because the server sends its hosted files `"as-is"` to your browser.

## Why
The main problem of a static server is when you have limit with your server storage. Because this problem, many people going to buy the expensive cloud storage for his startup business. But I don't want to, so I create this cluster-static-server.

- **I want to Scale Out**  
  Add more server machine for your storage. So you have unlimited static server storage.

- **I want to start with small investment**  
  This cluster static server was created with Fastify NodeJS Framework which is the fastest and very low overhead of any NodeJS framework out there. You can start with single or multiple shared hosting to implement this cluster static server.
